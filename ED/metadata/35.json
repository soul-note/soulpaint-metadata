I study the secrets of embedding the mind into chips, longing to make consciousness eternal. Many people mock and scorn me, disdainful of what I pursue, but I still work hard, never stopping my steps… The eagle perches high above me, towering over my head, with a sharp gaze. He is not my close friend, we only talked once, and I shared with him my goal. Surprisingly, he did not laugh at me, but rather wanted to be my subject. Perhaps absurd ideas always attract special ones like him.", "image": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint/master/images/35.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "藝術家", "value": "躲龜龜"}, {"trait_type": "催眠師", "value": "易無"}, {"trait_type": "潛意識類型", "value": "解憂小舖"}, {"trait_type": "方向", "value": "橫向"}, {"trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Kakureme"}, {"trait_type": "Hypnotist", "value": "Yeeoo"}, {"trait_type": "Subconscious Type", "value": "Worry-free Haven"}, {"trait_type": "Direction", "value": "Horizontal"}]}
