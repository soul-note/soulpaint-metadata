My heart was joyful, yet there was a faint sense of loneliness. As I gazed at the endless sea and sky, I felt the passage of time, and the ups and downs of life, like the ebb and flow of the tides.\n\n\n\nIn my twenties, I had too many pursuits and goals to achieve. But when I finally attained them, life did not change significantly. In the long river of time, dryness, bitterness, and sweetness alternated constantly, while I kept walking forward freely. Now, standing here, I realize what I need is relaxation and tranquility.\n\n\n\nI strolled along the coastline, watching the waves gradually recede, and the feeling of loneliness slowly dissipated. The scenery around me was picturesque, as if time had stood still. The sea, the sky, and the sand all merged into a perfect harmony. It was a moment of peace and contentment, as if nothing else in the world mattered.\n\n", "image": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint/master/images/4.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "藝術家", "value": "潘洛"}, {"trait_type": "催眠師", "value": "易無"}, {"trait_type": "潛意識類型", "value": "潛意識世界"}, {"trait_type": "方向", "value": "橫向"}, {"trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Panlu"}, {"trait_type": "Hypnotist", "value": "Yeeoo"}, {"trait_type": "Subconscious Type", "value": "Subconscious World"}, {"trait_type": "Direction", "value": "Horizontal"}]}
