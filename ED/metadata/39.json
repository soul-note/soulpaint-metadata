He was a handsome man with a height of six feet, holding a cup of coffee and lost in thought. This person was the α male I had been seeking.\n\n\n\nApproaching him, I said, \"I have been struggling with β thinking lately, and I request that you take charge of my personality for a year.\"\n\n\n\nThe α male brewed another cup of coffee and handed it to me, gently stroking my head as he spoke, \"Do not worry, leave it to me. Focus on the present moment, and do not let your consciousness interfere. In the future, follow your heart's feelings.\"\n\n\n\nWe embraced each other and left the realm of the subconscious, creating wonders together.", "image": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint/master/images/39.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "藝術家", "value": "潘洛"}, {"trait_type": "催眠師", "value": "薇若妮卡"}, {"trait_type": "潛意識類型", "value": "潛意識居民"}, {"trait_type": "方向", "value": "橫向"}, {"trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Panlu"}, {"trait_type": "Hypnotist", "value": "Veronica"}, {"trait_type": "Subconscious Type", "value": "Subconscious Residents"}, {"trait_type": "Direction", "value": "Horizontal"}]}
