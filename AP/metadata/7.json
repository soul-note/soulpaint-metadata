Walking alongside me in the field is my wife, dressed in an elegant kimono. After the war ended, we didn't know where to go, so we followed the mountain path back home. As we embarked on our journey, the sight before us was desolate - on the right side of the rice field were destroyed houses, but diligent farmers still worked hard in the fields. The sunset slowly fell from our left, dyeing the entire sky red.\n\n\n\nAt that moment, we passed a tall tree. The tree's grandeur resonated deep within my soul, as if the tree was reminding me to become a strong person like it, standing tall and unshaken like a towering tree.\n\n\n\nIn this moment, we seemed to be in a poetic and dreamlike scene. As the sunset spilled, the tree stood tall and strong, and we would continue to bravely face various challenges in life, constantly growing and flourishing.", "image": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint-ap/master/images/7.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "藝術家", "value": "躲龜龜"}, {"trait_type": "催眠師", "value": "易無"}, {"trait_type": "潛意識類型", "value": "前世回溯"}, {"trait_type": "方向", "value": "橫向"}, {"trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Kakureme"}, {"trait_type": "Hypnotist", "value": "Yeeoo"}, {"trait_type": "Subconscious Type", "value": "Past Life Regression"}, {"trait_type": "Direction", "value": "Horizontal"}]}
