Before me was a small waterfall, with a pool of water that shone in hues of purple and pink. I was enchanted by its beauty. Around me were cascading waterfalls and flowing streams, and I felt as though I was in a fairyland, completely immersed in its magic.\n\n\n\nSuddenly, a mysterious figure in a deep brown cloak appeared behind the waterfall, carrying a lantern and standing against an ancient tree. Meanwhile, I held a colorful, luminous ball in my hand.\n\n\n\nHere, I felt free and at ease, surrounded by a sense of tolerance and understanding, just like the natural and unrestrained flow of water. I was lost in its beauty and it was as if I was in a fairyland, completely forgetting the mundane chaos and clamor of the world.","image":"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint-ap/master/images/5.png","attributes":[{"trait_type":"藝術家","value":"潘洛"},{"trait_type":"催眠師","value":"易無"},{"trait_type":"潛意識類型","value":"靈魂居所"},{"trait_type":"方向","value":"橫向"},{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Panlu"},{"trait_type":"Hypnotist","value":"Yeeoo"},{"trait_type":"SubconsciousType","value":"Soul Abode"},{"trait_type":"Direction","value":"Horizontal"}]}
