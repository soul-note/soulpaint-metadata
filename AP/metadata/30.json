{"name":"【SP #30】遺忘的村落｜Forgotten Village","description":"【夢境故事】\n\n藍天白雲，遠方連綿的山脈屹立於天際，穿越山脈的河川在眼前蜿蜒流淌。原始村落在視野的左前方，遠至難以辨認，我卻身處極高的地方，隱約可見那萬物生長之處。我站在雲電梯內，懸浮於雲間，雲霧繚繞，窗外的結界透射出白色光芒，恍若置身仙境。\n\n\n\n我忐忑不安，卻也充滿好奇，因為我即將迎接我過去的自己，探索那個未知的自我，期待著尋找到失落的記憶。\n\n-\n\n【Dream Story】\n\nUnder the blue sky and white clouds, the distant mountain range stood tall on the horizon, and the river snaked through the mountains before me. The primitive village lay ahead on the left, its distance too far to discern. Yet I stood at a great height, peering towards the source of all life. Within the cloud elevator, I floated in the mist, surrounded by a white glow that seemed to transport me to a magical realm.\n\n\n\nDespite feeling anxious, I was also filled with curiosity, as I was about to meet my past self and explore the unknown depths of my being. With great anticipation, I hoped to uncover the lost memories I had been searching for.","image":"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint/master/images/30.png","attributes":[{"trait_type":"藝術家","value":"躲龜龜"},{"trait_type":"催眠師","value":"薇若妮卡"},{"trait_type":"潛意識類型","value":"前世回溯"},{"trait_type":"方向","value":"橫向"},{"trait_type":"Artist","value":"Kakureme"},{"trait_type":"Hypnotist","value":"Veronica"},{"trait_type":"SubconsciousType","value":"Past Life Regression"},{"trait_type":"Direction","value":"Horizontal"}]}
