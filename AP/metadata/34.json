Underneath the highway were rows of houses, while the city and mountains met at the border. As I strolled along the road, I saw bustling pedestrians, but no trace of cars. It dawned on me that in the future, cars no longer traveled on the road, but flew in the sky.\n\n\n\nIn the distance, a magnificent glass building caught my eye. It towered into the clouds, with two beautiful gardens and pools on its rooftop. I felt that the future me was inside that building, possessing a noble status. As I gazed at the building, a poetic phrase came to mind: \"The fairy dances in the blue sky, wandering in the floating world.\" The dreamlike scenery filled me with deep awe and emotion.", "image": "https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/soul-note/soulpaint-ap/master/images/34.png", "attributes": [{"trait_type": "藝術家", "value": "潘洛"}, {"trait_type": "催眠師", "value": "薇若妮卡"}, {"trait_type": "潛意識類型", "value": "來生預感"}, {"trait_type": "方向", "value": "縱向"}, {"trait_type": "Artist", "value": "Panlu"}, {"trait_type": "Hypnotist", "value": "Veronica"}, {"trait_type": "Subconscious Type", "value": "Premonitions of the Afterlife"}, {"trait_type": "Direction", "value": "Vertical"}]}
